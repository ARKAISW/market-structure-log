## Context
Gold experienced a strong impulsive advance on the 4-hour timeframe,
characterized by steep trend acceleration and consecutive higher highs.
Price moved rapidly away from prior value, indicating overextension
from equilibrium.

## Technical Observation
The action peaked out at or just below the upper Fibonacci levels and then failed to stay above them, falling back sharply.

The correction passed through a number of Fibonacci levels, breaking the sharp trendline that defined the impulsive phase.
This kind of action is more indicative of momentum exhaustion than a smooth change in trend.
RSI turned sharply from strong levels and fell, indicating a rapid loss of bullish momentum.
The speed and extent of the action indicate liquidation pressure, likely working off long positions accumulated during the parabolic phase.

## Interpretation
The current decline appears to be a corrective liquidation following
overextension, rather than an immediate structural trend reversal.

Further downside or consolidation would be expected until price
re-establishes acceptance and momentum stabilizes.

## Notes
This entry documents an impulsive advance followed by a liquidation-style
pullback on the 4-hour timeframe.
