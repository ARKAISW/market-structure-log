## Context

Ethereum has experienced an aggressive downside expansion following distribution near higher supply zones.  
Price has now reached a major support region, with momentum stretched and volatility expanding.

Historically, similar impulse declines on this timeframe have resulted in sharp V-shaped recoveries.

## Observation

- **Prior Analogue:**  
  Previous daily sell-offs were followed by rapid upside rotations once exhaustion formed near support zones.

- **Current Structure:**  
  Price is reacting from a lower demand region after breaking through key retracement levels.

- **Fibonacci Interaction:**  
  The move extended into deeper retracement territory, suggesting capitulation behavior rather than controlled pullback.

- **Momentum:**  
  Indicators show stretched downside conditions, increasing probability of short-term rebound.

- **Supply Overhead:**  
  Multiple supply zones remain above (notably near 3.0k–3.5k region), acting as primary resistance targets in case of recovery.

---

## Hypothesis

A **V-shaped recovery attempt is possible** if:

- Price holds current demand  
- Momentum stabilizes and shifts  
- Higher lows begin forming on the daily timeframe  

Such a recovery would initially be treated as corrective unless prior supply is reclaimed with acceptance.

Failure to hold current support would invalidate the V-recovery analogue and maintain bearish continuation bias.

---

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance below current demand region  
- Continued expansion with no structural higher low  
- RSI failing to stabilize and remain depressed  

---

## Notes

This analysis compares current price behavior with prior daily V-shaped recovery structures.  
The setup remains conditional and dependent on support holding.
