Hint:
Context
Ethereum showed a sharp impulsive advance in the 15-minute timeframe.

following a period of consolidation. The move resulted in a visible price

inefficiency, leaving behind a fair value gap (FVG).
The impulse took place into prior resistance, then momentum started
to weaken rather than accelerate.

Observation

After the impulsive leg, price failed to show sustained acceptance.
above the recent high. Subsequent candles showed overlapping structure and

Retracement behavior instead of continuation.

This reaction corroborates that the move could have been liquidity-driven, with
late participation rather than strong initiative buying.

Hypothesis Price may revisit the identified fair value gap to rebalance the inefficiency before establishing clearer short-term directional bias. This would be consistent with the mean-reverting tendencies observed, 
after impulsive expansions lacking follow-through. Review Notes This post is archived in support of a personal market structure research archive. It is only meant for documentation and skill development purposes.
