## Context

Ethereum had been trading within a broad consolidation range on the daily timeframe, capped by major overhead resistance and supported by rising short-term structure.  
This balance phase resolved to the downside, leading to a sharp expansion lower.

Price is now trading well below key moving averages and prior range equilibrium.

---

## Observation

- **Range Resolution:**  
  Price failed to sustain acceptance near the upper boundary of the range and broke down decisively, confirming bearish resolution rather than continuation higher.

- **Moving Averages:**  
  ETH is trading below the 20, 50, 100, and 200 EMAs, all of which are now acting as dynamic resistance. This alignment reflects strong bearish control on the daily timeframe.

- **Fibonacci Extension:**  
  The sell-off extended beyond the lower retracement levels, indicating impulsive behavior rather than a controlled pullback.

- **Momentum (MACD):**  
  MACD shows aggressive downside momentum with expanding negative histogram, suggesting active trend participation rather than exhaustion at this stage.

- **Price Behavior:**  
  Recent candles show vertical expansion with limited overlap, characteristic of a momentum-driven move rather than range conditions.

## Hypothesis

The market has transitioned from **balance to expansion** on the daily timeframe.

As long as price remains below prior range support and key moving averages, the bias remains **bearish**, with any upside moves treated as corrective unless followed by sustained acceptance and structural reclaim.

Stabilization or consolidation may occur after such expansion, but trend invalidation would require higher-timeframe structure shift rather than short-term reaction.

---

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance back inside the prior daily range  
- Sustained reclaim of major moving averages  
- Momentum contraction with structural higher lows  

---

## Notes

This analysis documents a **daily timeframe bearish expansion following range failure**.
