## Context

Ethereum delivered a strong upside impulse from demand, breaking prior short-term structure and expanding into premium pricing.

Following the expansion, price retraced and is now interacting with a defined supply zone aligned with prior structure and Fibonacci confluence.

Short-term structure is transitioning from impulsive to corrective.

---

## Observation

### 1️⃣ Impulse → Retracement Shift
- Strong bullish displacement created higher highs.
- Momentum stalled near the 0.786 retracement of the prior swing.
- Rejection printed inside overhead supply.

Expansion phase has cooled into consolidation.

### 2️⃣ Supply Confluence
- Current price trading beneath marked supply zone.
- Previous attempt to break higher failed.
- Upper Bollinger Band flattening, signaling reduced momentum.

### 3️⃣ Fibonacci Interaction
- Reaction occurred around 0.618–0.786 region.
- Price failed to sustain above premium area.
- Now rotating around equilibrium (0.5 zone).

### 4️⃣ Momentum Condition
- RSI cooled from prior elevated levels.
- No strong bullish expansion on latest bounce.
- EMAs compressing, suggesting decision point.

## Hypothesis

While broader move originated from demand, current positioning under supply favors cautious or short-term bearish bias.

Two conditional paths:

### Scenario A — Rejection & Lower High
Failure to reclaim supply could form a lower high and initiate rotation back toward discount or demand levels.

### Scenario B — Break & Continuation
Strong displacement and close above supply would invalidate short thesis and reopen continuation toward higher liquidity.

Until supply is decisively reclaimed, upside momentum remains capped.

## Invalidation / Confirmation

- 1H close above supply with follow-through → bullish continuation.
- Clear lower high beneath supply → bearish rotation confirmed.

## Notes

This setup documents the transition from bullish impulse to corrective consolidation under a defined supply zone, where acceptance or rejection will determine next directional expansion.
