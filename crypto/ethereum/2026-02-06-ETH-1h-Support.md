## Context

Ethereum experienced a sustained intraday decline, forming a descending price channel and approaching a previously identified support region.  
This area coincides with prior reaction lows and acted as a decision zone for short-term price behavior.

---

## Observation

- **Support Zone Reaction:**  
  Price respected a key support region, halting the decline and producing a clear bullish response. Selling pressure diminished upon interaction with this zone, suggesting short-term demand absorption.

- **Reversal Structure:**  
  Following support defense, price formed a bullish reversal and began to retrace higher, exiting the descending channel structure.

- **Fibonacci Interaction:**  
  The rebound successfully reclaimed multiple Fibonacci retracement levels from the prior downswing, indicating strength in the corrective move rather than a shallow reaction.

- **Momentum Indicators:**  
  MACD shows improving momentum with a developing bullish crossover, while RSI has rotated higher toward the mid-range, supporting the reversal thesis.

---

## Hypothesis

The defense of support combined with Fibonacci level reclamation suggests a **short-term corrective bullish phase**.

Continuation of this move would require:
- Sustained acceptance above reclaimed retracement levels  
- Momentum holding above neutral zones  

Failure to maintain acceptance would shift focus back toward range behavior rather than trend continuation.

---

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Loss of the defended support zone  
- Momentum divergence with RSI failing to hold mid-range  
- Re-entry into the descending channel structure

This analysis documents a **short-term reversal within a broader corrective context** and does not assume higher-timeframe trend change.
