## Context

Ethereum remains in a broader short-term bearish structure following a strong downside displacement.  
Lower highs and sustained trading below supply confirm bearish trend alignment on the 1H timeframe.

Price recently rotated into a deeper discount zone after completing an impulsive leg down.

---

## Observation

### 1️⃣ Bearish Structure
- Clear lower high formed beneath prior supply.
- Downside impulse created structural shift.
- EMAs remain stacked bearishly and act as dynamic resistance.

Trend remains aligned to the downside.

### 2️⃣ Fibonacci Interaction
- Retracement failed near the 0.618–0.786 region.
- Price rotated back toward the 1.0 (swing low) area.
- Current reaction forming at discount support.

Bounce appears reactive rather than impulsive.

### 3️⃣ Volatility Compression
- Bollinger Bands expanded during impulse, now compressing.
- Price holding near lower band support.
- RSI remains in lower range, reflecting weak bullish momentum.

### 4️⃣ Current Positioning
- Price attempting minor recovery from swing low.
- Still trading below key intraday supply zone.

## Hypothesis

Structure favors continuation while below retracement supply.

Two conditional paths:

### Scenario A — Bearish Continuation
Failure to reclaim the 0.5–0.618 region opens continuation toward deeper liquidity and potential expansion lower.

### Scenario B — Reclaim & Stabilization
Strong reclaim above EMA cluster and retracement supply would suggest absorption and possible short-term balance formation.

Until supply is reclaimed, bias remains structurally bearish on 1H.

---

## Invalidation / Confirmation

- Break above retracement supply → bearish thesis weakens.
- Formation of new lower low → continuation confirmed.

## Notes

This setup documents impulse-retracement behavior within an established bearish 1H structure, with reaction forming at discount but lacking structural reclaim.
