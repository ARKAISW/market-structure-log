## Context

Ethereum is trading within a broader bearish structure following a sustained impulsive decline.  
Price has approached a previously untested demand zone formed near the lower bounds of the recent range, where downside momentum has begun to decelerate.

The current environment reflects a post-impulse phase rather than trend expansion.

## Observation

- **Demand Zone Reaction:**  
  Price is reacting to a major demand zone roughly between 2150 and 2250, where the selling pressure seems to be easing. This area also corresponds to a weak low sweep, which suggests short-term absorption rather than a strong continuation.

- **Structure & Momentum:**  
  The downside pattern is still in place on the 4-hour chart, but the recent price action shows less range development and a pause at the lows, typical of short-term stabilization.

- **RSI:**  
  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the oversold area and is starting to stabilize, which supports the view of a short-term exhaustion rather than a strong continuation.

- **Price Behavior:**  
  The current price development suggests a corrective reaction to the demand zone rather than an immediate entry below the range.

## Hypothesis

The most likely outcome is a corrective retreat originating from the current demand area.

A move towards the 2400-2500 supply area is possible, a region where previous selling pressure could re-emerge. In the event of continued corrective momentum, a deeper move towards about the 2700 level, 
labeled as previous support turned resistance and region of equilibrium, cannot be ruled out.

Nonetheless, the overall outlook is negative unless prices revert to these levels with a clear change in structure.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance below the 2150 demand region  
- Renewed downside momentum with expanding candle ranges  
- RSI continuation deeper into oversold territory without recovery  

---

## Notes

This analysis documents a **4H corrective response within a broader bearish regime**.  
Directional continuation will depend on acceptance at higher resistance zones and evidence of structural change rather than short-term reaction alone.
