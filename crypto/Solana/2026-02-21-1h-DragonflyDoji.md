## Context

Solana rebounded from a defined support region after a corrective pullback.  
Price had retraced into deeper Fibonacci levels before printing a clear reversal signal on the 1H timeframe.

The environment shifted from corrective consolidation to directional upside momentum.

---

## Observation

### 1️⃣ Dragonfly Doji at Support
- A dragonfly doji formed near structural support.
- Long lower wick indicates strong rejection of lower prices.
- Buyers absorbed downside liquidity and regained control into the close.

### 2️⃣ Momentum Expansion
- Subsequent candles showed strong bullish continuation.
- EMAs aligned upward on the 1H.
- RSI pushed above mid-range, confirming strength.

### 3️⃣ Structure
- Higher low formed relative to prior swing.
- Price approaching local supply / prior range highs.

---

## Hypothesis

As long as higher low structure holds, bullish momentum remains intact.

Two conditional paths:

### Scenario A — Continuation
Acceptance above current resistance opens room toward upper supply.

### Scenario B — Rejection
Failure at supply may result in short-term pullback toward mid-range support.

Current bias: bullish while structure remains intact.

## Invalidation

- Breakdown below the dragonfly doji low.
- Loss of higher low structure.

This setup documents bullish rejection at support followed by momentum expansion.
