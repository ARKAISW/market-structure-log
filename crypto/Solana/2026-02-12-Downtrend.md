## Context

Solana has broken below prior structural lows, confirming continuation of the daily downtrend.  
The market is currently trading beneath all major moving averages, reinforcing bearish higher-timeframe control.

The recent impulsive sell-off created a visible imbalance (Fair Value Gap), followed by sideways compression.

---

## Observation

- **Market Structure:**  
  Clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The break of prior support confirms trend continuation.

- **Fair Value Gap (FVG):**  
  The impulsive move lower left an inefficiency (highlighted zone). Price is currently consolidating beneath this area, suggesting ongoing rebalancing.

- **Sideways Compression:**  
  Post-impulse movement is overlapping and range-bound, indicating temporary equilibrium rather than immediate continuation.

- **Momentum (RSI):**  
  RSI is in oversold territory, signaling momentum exhaustion risk. However, oversold conditions alone do not imply reversal without structural shift.

## Hypothesis

The broader bias remains **bearish** following the confirmed break of lower lows.

Two conditional paths emerge:

### Scenario 1 — Corrective Breakout
If price reclaims the green FVG zone and receives sustained acceptance, a corrective push toward higher resistance levels becomes possible.

### Scenario 2 — Continuation
Failure to break and hold above the FVG increases the probability of renewed downside expansion, maintaining the dominant downtrend structure.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance above the FVG and reclaim of prior lower high  
- Sustained movement above key moving averages  
- Structural higher high formation on the daily timeframe
