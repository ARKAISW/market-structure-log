## Context

Solana reacted strongly from a defined demand zone (~76 region), initiating a sharp recovery leg.  
Price is now retracing upward into a higher-timeframe supply zone after completing a measured Fibonacci retracement of the prior downswing.

The broader structure remains corrective within a larger bearish regime.

---

## Observation

- **Demand Reaction:**  
  Strong impulse originated from the lower demand area, suggesting temporary exhaustion of selling pressure.

- **Fibonacci Structure:**  
  Price has retraced through the 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 levels, approaching the 0.786 retracement — a region often associated with deeper corrective rallies.

- **Supply Overhead:**  
  A major supply zone (highlighted in green) sits above current price (~89–98 region), acting as the primary resistance cluster.

- **Momentum:**  
  Recovery has been directional but remains beneath higher-timeframe resistance. Indicators show improvement but not full structural shift.

- **Range Dynamics:**  
  Current movement resembles a corrective leg rather than impulsive breakout behavior.

## Hypothesis

Price is interacting with a key resistance decision zone.

Two conditional scenarios:

### Scenario 1 — Rejection
Failure to gain acceptance inside the supply zone may result in rotation back toward mid-range or demand support.

### Scenario 2 — Break & Acceptance
Sustained acceptance above the 0.786 retracement and inside supply would increase probability of testing upper supply boundaries.

Until structural higher highs are confirmed, this remains a corrective advance within a broader bearish context.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Strong breakout with acceptance above supply  
- Formation of higher high on 4H  
- Sustained bullish momentum expansion
