## Context
Bitcoin is currently trading within a broader impulsive structure on the
4-hour timeframe, following a strong upward expansion earlier in the move.
After the impulse, price entered a consolidation phase above key moving
averages and within the Fibonacci retracement framework.

## Observation
Several prior consolidation regions (highlighted in cyan) display similar
structural characteristics:
- Sideways compression following an impulsive expansion
- Price holding above medium-term moving averages
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) stabilizing near the neutral 50 level

In each historical instance observed on this chart, resolution from this
structure was followed by a continuation to the upside.

At present, price is again consolidating within a comparable structural
region, with RSI returning to approximately the 50 level.

## Hypothesis
If the current consolidation resolves in a manner consistent with prior
instances, price may attempt continuation toward the next Fibonacci
extension level.

This hypothesis is contingent on price maintaining structural support
and acceptance above the current consolidation range.
