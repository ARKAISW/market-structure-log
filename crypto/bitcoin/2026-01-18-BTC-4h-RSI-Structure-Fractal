## Context
Bitcoin is currently progressing through a broader impulsive structure on the
4-hour timeframe, following a strong upward expansion earlier in the move.
After the impulse, price entered a consolidation phase while holding above
key medium-term moving averages.

## Observation
Several prior consolidation regions (marked in cyan) exhibit similar
structural characteristics:
- Horizontal compression following an impulsive expansion
- Price maintaining acceptance above medium-term moving averages
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) stabilizing near the neutral 50 level

In each instance observed on this chart, the resolution from this structure
was followed by a continuation to the upside.

At present, price is again consolidating within a comparable structural
region, with RSI returning to approximately the 50 level.

## Hypothesis
If the current consolidation resolves in a manner consistent with prior
occurrences, price may attempt continuation toward the next Fibonacci
extension level.

This hypothesis is contingent on the preservation of structural support
and sustained acceptance within the current consolidation range.
