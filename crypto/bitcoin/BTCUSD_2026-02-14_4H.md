## Context

Bitcoin is trading within a broader consolidation range following a prior impulsive decline.  
Price has rebounded from local lows and is now approaching mid-range resistance.

The market remains positioned beneath higher-timeframe supply and downward-sloping resistance.

---

## Observation

- **Fibonacci Structure:**  
  The 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level of the prior downswing is currently acting as resistance.  
  Price is reacting at this midpoint rather than reclaiming higher retracement levels.

- **Range Environment:**  
  Market remains inside a defined consolidation zone, with clear support below and supply overhead (~72k region).

- **Dynamic Resistance:**  
  Price is still trading beneath major moving averages, which are flattening but not yet signaling structural shift.

- **Momentum (RSI):**  
  RSI is recovering toward mid-range levels but has not yet established sustained bullish expansion.

## Hypothesis

The 0.5 Fibonacci level is functioning as a **decision zone**.

Two conditional paths:

### Scenario 1 — Rejection
Failure to reclaim and hold above 0.5 may result in renewed rotation toward lower range support.

### Scenario 2 — Acceptance
Sustained acceptance above 0.5 would increase probability of testing upper range resistance and overhead supply.

Until acceptance is confirmed, the environment remains corrective within a broader consolidation structure.

---

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Strong acceptance above the 0.5 level followed by higher high formation  
- Breakdown below recent higher low, confirming renewed bearish expansion
