## Context

Bitcoin remains within a clear bearish structure on the 4-hour timeframe following multiple impulsive sell-offs.  
Price continues to respect lower highs and lower lows, with prior demand zones failing to produce sustained reversals.

Current price action is unfolding beneath multiple **unfilled Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)**, indicating inefficiency left by aggressive selling.

---

## Observation

- **Fair Value Gaps:**  
  Multiple bearish FVGs (highlighted in green) remain unmitigated above price, particularly in the **77k–80k** and **83k** regions. These zones act as overhead supply unless reclaimed with acceptance.

- **Momentum (MACD):**  
  MACD remains below the zero line, with momentum still favoring the downside. Recent histogram contraction reflects short-term slowing, not a confirmed reversal.

- **RSI:**  
  RSI is currently near **28**, indicating oversold conditions. This supports the possibility of a corrective bounce but does not invalidate the broader bearish regime.

- **Price Behavior:**  
  Recent price action shows repeated relief rallies (72 → 76 → 72), suggesting liquidity-driven reactions rather than structural trend change.

---

## Hypothesis

The market is currently at a **decision point** between continuation and correction.

### Scenario 1 — Corrective Expansion (Conditional)
If price stabilizes and reclaims lower FVG levels, a corrective rotation toward:
- **~77k–78k**, and potentially  
- **~83k** (higher timeframe FVG / prior supply)

is possible. Such a move would be classified as a **bear market rally**, not a trend reversal, unless acceptance occurs above these zones.

### Scenario 2 — Bearish Continuation
Failure to reclaim lower FVGs, followed by renewed momentum expansion, increases the probability of continuation toward:
- **~73k**, and potentially  
- **~63k**, aligned with prior liquidity pools and structural extension targets.

---

## Notes on Candlestick Signals

Bullish engulfing candles observed at prior lows (93k, 83k, 73k) have historically resulted in **short-term relief moves**, not sustained reversals.  
In the current structure, similar signals are treated as **reactive responses** unless confirmed by higher-timeframe structure shift.

---

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance above 83k with structural shift on 4H  
- Sustained momentum expansion into higher FVGs  
- RSI reclaiming and holding above mid-range with price acceptance  

---

## Notes

This analysis documents **conditional scenarios within a dominant bearish structure**.  
Directional bias remains to the downside unless invalidated by acceptance above key inefficiency zones.
