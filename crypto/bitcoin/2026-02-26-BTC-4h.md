## Context

Bitcoin rotated aggressively from local demand, reclaiming mid-range levels after a corrective leg.  
However, price is now approaching a higher timeframe resistance (purple zone) that has historically acted as supply.

The broader structure remains range-bound beneath major overhead supply.

---

## Observation

### 1️⃣ Resistance Interaction
- Multiple attempts to push above the purple HTF resistance.
- Repeated upper wicks showing rejection.
- No strong acceptance or displacement above the level.

This indicates active supply absorption at resistance.

### 2️⃣ Structural Position
- Recent rally formed a strong impulsive leg from discount.
- Current candles show slowing momentum near resistance.
- Failure to print a decisive higher high beyond the zone.

### 3️⃣ Fibonacci Confluence
- Price retraced into premium territory of the recent impulse.
- Reaction occurring near 0.5–0.618 equilibrium area.
- Resistance aligns with premium pricing.

### 4️⃣ Momentum Condition
- RSI recovering but not expanding aggressively.
- Momentum flattening as price compresses under resistance.

## Hypothesis

While short-term structure improved from the lows, failure to break and hold above purple resistance suggests potential rejection.

Two conditional paths:

### Scenario A — Rejection & Rotation Lower
Continued inability to reclaim resistance could trigger rotation back toward equilibrium or deeper discount levels.

### Scenario B — Break & Acceptance
Strong displacement and close above purple resistance would invalidate rejection thesis and open continuation toward higher supply.

Until acceptance is seen, resistance remains respected.

## Invalidation / Confirmation

- 4H close above purple zone with follow-through → bullish continuation.
- Lower high formation beneath resistance → rejection confirmed.

## Notes

This setup documents repeated interaction with a higher timeframe resistance level, where lack of acceptance suggests supply remains active.
