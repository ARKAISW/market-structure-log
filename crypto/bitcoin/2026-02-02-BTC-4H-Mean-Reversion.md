## Context

Bitcoin is trading below prior value following a strong impulsive sell-off on the 4-hour timeframe.  
Price is currently positioned near the lower bounds of the recent range, with volatility compression emerging after the expansion phase.

Momentum conditions suggest exhaustion of directional selling pressure rather than continuation, pointing toward a short-term stabilization or mean-reversion environment.

## Observation

- **MACD:**  
 The MACD and signal lines approach each other very closely around the zero axis, indicating a lack of strong momentum and a lack of strong directional dominance. 
 The histogram magnitude continues to remain muted, consistent with a non-trending market.

- **Candlestick Structure:**  
 A bullish engulfing pattern has formed after a phase of downside extension, indicating a short-term response to demand rather than a strong trend reversal.

- **RSI:**  
 The RSI had previously moved into the oversold region and is currently moving towards the center line, indicating a reduction in the pressure on the downside and a return to normal momentum conditions.


- **Price Behavior:**  
  Price action indicates an attempt to return toward its prior mean rather than initiate a fresh impulsive leg. Follow-through remains limited.

## Hypothesis

Market conditions currently favor **mean reversion over trend continuation**.

The confluence of:
- Momentum compression (MACD bisecting),
- Local demand response (bullish engulfing),
- RSI recovery from oversold levels,

suggests the market is stabilizing after aggressive selling rather than establishing a new directional trend.

Sustained deviation away from the mean would require renewed momentum expansion and structural acceptance beyond nearby levels.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Expansion in downside momentum with increasing MACD histogram amplitude  
- RSI failure to reclaim the mid-range followed by rollover  
- Acceptance below recent local lows

## Notes

This document records a **4H post-impulse stabilization phase** and does not assume directional bias beyond observed conditions.  
Further structure development will determine whether price remains range-bound or transitions into a broader trend.
