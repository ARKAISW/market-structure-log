## Context

Bitcoin experienced a sharp impulsive decline, forming a well-defined descending channel before reacting strongly from a lower demand zone.  
The bounce that followed represents a relief move within a broader corrective environment rather than a confirmed trend reversal.

Price is currently trading between clearly defined **demand below** and multiple **overhead supply zones**, placing the market in a short-term balance phase.

## Observation

- **Demand Zone Reaction:**  
  Price reacted decisively from a key demand region around the mid-60k area, suggesting short-term absorption of sell-side liquidity and exhaustion of immediate downside pressure.

- **Impulsive Recovery:**  
  The rebound out of demand was sharp and directional, breaking the descending channel structure and indicating a shift from expansion to consolidation.

- **Supply Overhead:**  
  Multiple supply zones remain stacked above current price (notably around ~72k, ~76k, and higher), acting as potential resistance and areas where selling pressure may re-enter.

- **RSI:**  
  RSI has recovered from oversold levels and is now hovering near the mid-range, consistent with a neutral-to-corrective regime rather than strong trend continuation.

---

## Hypothesis

The market is transitioning from **impulse to range**.

As long as price remains above the defended demand zone, short-term consolidation or corrective upside rotations are possible.  
However, sustained bullish continuation would require acceptance above nearby supply zones; otherwise, price may continue to rotate between demand and supply without establishing a directional trend.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Loss of the defended demand zone  
- Rejection and expansion from overhead supply with increasing downside momentum  
- RSI rolling over and failing to hold the mid-range

## Notes

This analysis documents a **post-impulse rebalancing phase** defined by supply–demand interaction rather than directional conviction.
