## Context
Bitcoin is trading within a well-defined horizontal range on the 1-hour
timeframe following a prior impulsive decline and subsequent recovery.

Price is currently oscillating within the middle of the range rather than
testing extreme support or resistance.

## Observation
The lack of a dominant momentum regime is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is stabilising close to the neutral 50 level.

With low-amplitude oscillations, MACD is hovering close to the zero line, indicating a balanced flow environment and weak trend strength.

The price is still contained within the recent Fibonacci retracement structure's range and close to its mid-level.

## Hypothesis
In the absence of renewed momentum, price may continue to rotate within
the current range rather than develop a sustained directional trend.

Directional bias remains unresolved and is contingent on acceptance
outside the established range.

## Notes
This entry documents a short-term neutral and balance regime observed on
