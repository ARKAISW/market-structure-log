## Context

Bitcoin is trading within a broader consolidation range after a prior impulsive move.  
Recent price action shows a corrective advance unfolding inside a rising channel, while the higher-timeframe range boundaries remain intact.

Price is currently positioned below the upper range resistance and above the lower range support, placing the market in a rotational regime rather than trend expansion.

---

## Observation

- **Range Structure:**  
  The market continues to respect a well-defined horizontal range, with repeated reactions at both upper and lower boundaries.

- **Corrective Channel:**  
  The current advance is occurring within a narrow rising channel, suggesting corrective behavior rather than impulsive upside expansion.

- **Fibonacci Interaction:**  
  Price is interacting with key Fibonacci retracement levels from the prior downswing, with reactions occurring near mid-range levels rather than full retracement.

- **Price Behavior:**  
  Momentum within the channel appears controlled, with overlapping candles and reduced range, consistent with consolidation rather than breakout conditions.

## Hypothesis

The market is in a **range rotation phase**.

As long as price remains inside the rising channel and below upper range resistance, upside moves are treated as corrective.  
A sustained breakout would require acceptance above the range high; failure to hold the channel increases the likelihood of rotation back toward the lower range support.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance above the upper range boundary with expanding momentum  
- Breakdown of the rising channel with downside acceleration  
- Loss of lower range support
