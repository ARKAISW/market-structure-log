## Context

Bitcoin is trading within a defined 4H range following prior downside expansion.  
Price attempted upside continuation but failed to sustain above mid-range levels, leading to rotation back toward local support.

The environment remains rotational rather than trending.

---

## Observation

### 1️⃣ Range Definition
- Blue rectangle marks the primary consolidation zone.
- Price continues oscillating between range high and range low without clear expansion.

### 2️⃣ Fibonacci Structure
- 0.5–0.618 region acted as resistance during retracement.
- Failure to reclaim deeper retracement levels signaled corrective behavior.

### 3️⃣ Liquidity Sweep
- Recent downside move swept local lows before showing stabilization.
- Reaction occurred near lower Bollinger Band and range support.

### 4️⃣ Momentum
- EMAs remain compressed.
- No strong directional expansion in momentum — consistent with range behavior.

## Hypothesis

Market is currently in balance.

Two conditional scenarios:

### Scenario A — Range Continuation
Price may rotate back toward mid-range / upper boundary if support holds.

### Scenario B — Breakdown
Acceptance below range lows would invalidate balance and trigger expansion lower.

Until range highs or lows are decisively broken, this remains a rotational environment.

## Invalidation / Confirmation

- Break & hold above range high → bullish expansion.
- Break & hold below range low → bearish expansion.

---

## Notes

This setup reflects range compression with liquidity sweeps at boundaries.  
Execution within such conditions requires defined risk and patience.
