## Context

BNB previously formed a prolonged narrow consolidation range before initiating an impulsive upside expansion.  
Following the pump, price transitioned into a broader sideways distribution phase before resolving to the downside.

The current structure reflects confirmed bearish continuation after range breakdown.

---

## Observation

- **Accumulation → Expansion:**  
  A tight sideways range preceded the upside impulse, suggesting accumulation before expansion.

- **Distribution → Breakdown:**  
  A broader sideways structure formed near highs, ultimately resolving into a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.  
  The breakdown below the neckline confirmed structural weakness.

- **Market Structure:**  
  Lower highs and lower lows now define the daily trend.

- **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs):**  
  The impulsive sell-off left visible inefficiencies (green rectangles) that may act as rebalancing targets if price attempts corrective rotation.

- **Key Levels:**  
  - **Yellow Line:** Long-term demand zone  
  - **Blue Line (0.618 Fibonacci):** Major retracement confluence level  
  These levels form a structural reaction area rather than a guaranteed reversal point.

- **Momentum (RSI):**  
  RSI is in lower territory, reflecting bearish momentum dominance.

## Hypothesis

The dominant structure remains **bearish** following confirmed distribution and breakdown.

Two conditional scenarios emerge:

### Scenario 1 — Corrective Rebalance
Price may rotate upward toward the FVG zones to rebalance inefficiencies before continuation.  
Acceptance above these zones would be required to shift bias.

### Scenario 2 — Demand Reaction
If price interacts with the long-term demand (yellow) and 0.618 Fibonacci confluence (blue), a reaction or corrective bounce is possible.  
Sustained reversal would require structural higher highs rather than temporary relief.

## Invalidation / Failure Mode

- Acceptance above FVG and prior lower high  
- Reclaim of key retracement levels with sustained momentum  
- Break of bearish structure on daily timeframe
